This is a browser add-on (Firefox and Chrome) that allows you to clip web pages to your Standard Notes account. The add-on let's you select the portion of the page you want to clip. It then adds the HTML content of that selection to your Standard Notes account.

Please use and share your feedback! And, of course, contributions are welcome!
